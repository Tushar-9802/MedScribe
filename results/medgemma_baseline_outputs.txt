INPUT TRANSCRIPT:
------------------------------------------------------------
45-year-old male with acute onset chest pain for two hours. Pain is sub-sternal, pressure-like, radiating to left arm, associated with diaphoresis and shortness of breath. Past medical history significant for hypertension and hyperlipidemia. Current medications include lacinopril and atovastatin. No known known drug allergies. Physical exam shows blood pressure 145 over 92. Heart rate 98. Respiratory rate 20. Diaphoretic. Mild distress. Cardiac exam regular rhythm. No murmurs. Lungs clear bilaterally. EKG shows ST elevations in leads 2. 3. An AVF.

GENERATED SOAP NOTE:
------------------------------------------------------------
SUBJECTIVE:
The patient is a 45-year-old male presenting with acute onset chest pain for two hours. The pain is described as sub-sternal, pressure-like, radiating to the left arm. Associated symptoms include diaphoresis and shortness of breath. The patient's past medical history is significant for hypertension and hyperlipidemia. He is currently taking lisinopril and atorvastatin. He denies any known drug allergies.

OBJECTIVE:
Physical exam reveals blood pressure of 145/92 mmHg. Heart rate is 98 beats per minute. Respiratory rate is 20 breaths per minute. The patient is diaphoretic and exhibits mild distress. Cardiac exam is unremarkable, with a regular rhythm and no murmurs. Lung auscultation is clear bilaterally. The EKG shows ST elevations in leads 2, 3, and aVF.

ASSESSMENT:
The patient is likely experiencing an acute myocardial infarction (MI), potentially with a location in the inferior wall. The ST elevations on the EKG are highly suggestive of this diagnosis.

PLAN:
1.  Immediate cardiac catheterization for possible percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI).
2.  Administer aspirin and clopidogrel.
3.  Administer oxygen and monitor vital signs closely.
4.  Prepare for possible transfer to the cardiac care unit (CCU).
5.  Consult cardiology.
6.  Monitor EKG continuously.
7.  Obtain cardiac enzymes (troponin).
8.  Consider heparin.

CASE 2

INPUT TRANSCRIPT:
------------------------------------------------------------
67-year-old female presenting with progressive dyspnea over three days. Associated with orthopnea, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, and bilateral lower extremity edema. Past medical history includes congestive heart failure, hypertension, and diabetes maletus type 2. Medications include furosamide, metaprolol, and metformin. Vital signs show blood pressure 160 over 95. Heart rate 110 irregular. Respiratory rate 28. Oxygen saturation 88% on room air. Physical exam reveals jugular venous distension, bilateral pulmonary crackles to mid-lumb fields, S3 gallop on cardiac auscultation, and 3-plus pitting edema bilaterally to knees.

SUBJECTIVE:
The patient is a 67-year-old female presenting with progressive dyspnea over three days. She reports orthopnea, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, and bilateral lower extremity edema. Her past medical history includes congestive heart failure, hypertension, and diabetes mellitus type 2. She is currently taking furosemide, metoprolol, and metformin.

OBJECTIVE:
Vital signs: Blood pressure 160/95 mmHg, heart rate 110 bpm, irregular; respiratory rate 28 breaths per minute; oxygen saturation 88% on room air. Physical exam reveals jugular venous distension, bilateral pulmonary crackles to mid-lung fields, an S3 gallop on cardiac auscultation, and 3+ pitting edema bilaterally to the knees.

ASSESSMENT:
The patient is presenting with acute decompensated heart failure, likely secondary to fluid overload. The irregular heart rate needs further investigation.

PLAN:
1.  Administer oxygen to maintain oxygen saturation above 90%.
2.  Obtain an electrocardiogram (ECG) to evaluate the irregular heart rate.
3.  Consider a chest X-ray to evaluate for pulmonary edema.
4.  Repeat blood pressure and oxygen saturation measurements.
5.  Initiate intravenous furosemide (Lasix) to reduce fluid overload.
6.  Monitor the patient's response to treatment and adjust medications as needed.
7.  Follow up with the patient's primary care physician.

SUBJECTIVE:
Patient is an 80-year-old male presenting with fever and cough for three days. The patient reports a fever to 102.5 Fahrenheit. Productive cough with yellow sputum. Associated symptoms include rhinorrhea, mild sore throat, decreased appetite, no vomiting, diarrhea, or rash. Patient's immunizations are up to date, according to the parents. The patient attends elementary school. There are multiple sick contacts. There is no recent travel. No known exposures to COVID-19 are reported.

OBJECTIVE:
Vital signs: Temperature 101.8 Fahrenheit, Heart rate 100 bpm, Respiratory rate 24 breaths per minute, Oxygen saturation 97% on room air. General appearance: Alert, interactive, mild nasal congestion, H-E-E-N-T. Nasal discharge present, oropharynx mildly erythematous without exudate. Lungs: Scattered ronchi bilaterally, no wheezing, no retractions.

ASSESSMENT:
Based on the subjective and objective findings, the most likely diagnosis is an upper respiratory infection, possibly bronchitis.

PLAN:
The patient should be monitored for worsening symptoms. Consider chest X-ray if respiratory status deteriorates. No specific treatment is indicated at this time. Follow up with primary care physician as needed.

**Explanation of the SOAP Note:**

*   **SUBJECTIVE:** This section includes the patient's reported symptoms, history, and any information provided by the parents.
*   **OBJECTIVE:** This section contains the physical exam findings, vital signs, and any other objective data collected during the examination.
*   **ASSESSMENT:** This section is a clinical impression or diagnosis based on the subjective and objective data.
*   **PLAN:** This section outlines any diagnostic tests, treatments, or follow-up actions recommended for the patient.

**Important Considerations:**

*   This is a basic SOAP note based on the provided transcript. A complete SOAP note would typically include more details and specific information relevant to the patient's case.
*   The assessment and plan should be tailored to the specific patient and their condition.
*   It is important to document all relevant information accurately and concisely.
*   This is not a substitute for professional medical advice.
*   This is a basic SOAP note, and a real-world SOAP note would be much more detailed.
*   The "H-E-E-N-T" notation
